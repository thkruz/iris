/**
 * @file TimeSkipController - Operator-driven fast-forward to the next contact
 * @description LEO scenarios spend most of their wall-clock time waiting for a
 * bird to rise. Scenarios 7 and 8 can put 40+ minutes of dead sky between the
 * shift starting and the pass the mission is actually about, which is realistic
 * and is also nothing to train on. This runs that wait at several hundred times
 * real speed and stops short of AOS, so the operator still does acquisition
 * themselves.
 *
 * It is a FAST-FORWARD, not a jump. Each animation frame advances the scenario
 * clock (and the mission clock) by one chunk, and the existing simulation loop
 * propagates orbits and evaluates objective conditions against every chunk. A
 * single `advanceClock(fortyMinutes)` would be one line instead of this file,
 * but nothing scheduled inside the skipped window would ever be evaluated.
 *
 * Two clocks move together, which is the whole reason mission-clock.ts exists:
 *   - the SCENARIO clock (OpsLogManager) - drives SGP4, pass prediction, the UTC
 *     display, and
 *   - the MISSION clock (missionNowMs) - drives every "seconds since mission
 *     start" mechanic: command windows, maneuvers, weather, interference,
 *     scoring elapsed time, COMSEC key age.
 * Advancing one without the other puts the console and the sky in different
 * hours.
 *
 * Opt-in per scenario via settings.timeSkip; campaigns that do not declare it
 * never see the control.
