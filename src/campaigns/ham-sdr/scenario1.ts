/**
 * ham-sdr Scenario 1 - "First Light" / QFH + APT first contact
 *
 * The campaign opener: one antenna (the fence-post QFH), one bird (WXSAT-19),
 * one job - catch the pass and decode the picture. Teaches the SDR Console's
 * three core interactions in sequence: click-to-tune (the rig boots with the
 * VFO parked 70 kHz high), channel bandwidth (it boots on a 15 kHz voice
 * channel that clips the 34 kHz APT signal), and leaving a working lock
 * alone (a 45 s hands-off hold). Plants the Doppler contrast that Scenario 2
 * cashes in: at 137 MHz the drift fits inside the channel, so once locked,
 * this one needs no chasing.
 *
 * Pass timeline (scenario clock starts 2027-06-19 16:00:00 UTC, same evening
 * as the sandbox - the RF envelope phase 1 verified live):
 * - WXSAT-19: AOS T+3.0 min, max el 55.1 deg at T+10.6, LOS T+18.3 min
 * - CUBEHOP-1 rises at T+18.0 (foreshadowed; the yagi arrives in Scenario 2)
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - K1032: Knowledge of satellite-based communication systems
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating communications equipment
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - K0645: Knowledge of standard operating procedures
 *   - T0153: Monitor system performance

/**
 * S1 boots the rig exactly as Riley left it after last night's FM session:
 * VFO parked at 137.170 MHz (70 kHz above the APT downlink, still inside the
 * 200 kHz waterfall view so the parked VFO box is visibly sitting beside the
 * stripe) on a 15 kHz voice channel. The 34 kHz APT signal cannot fit a
 * 15 kHz channel (the receiver drops signals wider than the modem bandwidth),
 * so the player must click-to-tune AND open the channel to 50 kHz - the two
 * SDR Console interactions this scenario exists to teach.
