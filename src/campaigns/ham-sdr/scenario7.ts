/**
 * ham-sdr Scenario 7 - "Margin Call" / local RFI foxhunt + marginal pass
 *
 * Local interference arc on the yagi rig. A neighbor's failing device starts
 * hashing the 70cm band (E1 terrestrial emitter at 435.36 MHz, ~1.2 km due
 * east): the noise floor jumps and tonight's only CUBEHOP pass is a LOW one -
 * 18.4 deg max el, the thinnest link margin of the campaign. The player:
 * 1. hears the hash and confirms it is local (no Doppler, no pass predicted),
 * 2. DFs it with manual yagi sweeps (MAN AZ control - signal peaks on the
 *    emitter bearing, due east),
 * 3. notches it out (FILTER section, one-knob notch at 435.360),
 * 4. narrows the IF filter to 100 kHz (lower noise gate) and catches the
 *    marginal pass with the margin they just clawed back.
 *
 * Timeline (scenario clock starts 2027-06-24 15:15:00 UTC):
 * - T+1:00  RFI on the air (continuous - accidents don't have duty cycles)
 * - CUBEHOP-1: AOS 15:35, max el 18.4 deg, LOS 15:46 (the margin call)
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - S0648: Skill in detecting anomalies
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating communications equipment
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - K0740: Knowledge of system performance indicators
 *   - T0153: Monitor system performance
