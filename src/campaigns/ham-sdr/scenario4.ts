/**
 * ham-sdr Scenario 4 - "Set and Forget" / AFC discovery, staged A/B in one pass
 *
 * The AFC payoff (per the phase-1 retro note: manual chase first, AFC second).
 * A single pass carries both halves - Doppler drift is fastest near AOS and
 * LOS and pauses at closest approach, so the first half is a real manual
 * chase and the second half shows the loop doing the same job hands-off:
 * 1. chase the first half by hand (receiver-afc-enabled { afcEnabled: false },
 *    lock held 90 s),
 * 2. engage AFC (receiver-afc-enabled, the new Campaign 3 condition),
 * 3. hands off through the back half (lock + C/N >= 10 held 120 s with AFC on).
 *
 * Pass timeline (scenario clock starts 2027-06-21 16:34:00 UTC - the third
 * evening; TLE epoch 2027-06-19, still well inside SGP4 validity). This is
 * the strongest pass of the campaign so far, nearly overhead:
 * - CUBEHOP-1: AOS T+4.8 min, max el 83.1 deg at T+11.2, LOS T+17.5 min
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating communications equipment
 *   - K0740: Knowledge of system performance indicators
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - K1032: Knowledge of satellite-based communication systems
 *   - T0153: Monitor system performance
