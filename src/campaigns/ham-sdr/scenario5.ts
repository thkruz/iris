/**
 * ham-sdr Scenario 5 - "The Noise Bump" / GPS L1 + spoofing detection
 *
 * Opens the security half of the campaign. Act 1: find GPS - a signal that
 * lives BELOW the noise floor and can be detected but never locked (spread
 * spectrum). Act 2: a GPS spoofer comes up a few blocks away. The tells are
 * the campaign's first adversarial lesson:
 * - a too-clean, too-strong carrier rises out of the gentle L1 hump
 *   (terrestrial emitter, E1 - and it never Dopplers);
 * - the SDR console's CLK deltaT readout starts walking while the SATS count
 *   stays healthy (a real outage drops satellites; a spoof keeps them).
 * Defense: stop trusting GPS - flip the reference to HOLDOVER and ride the
 * disciplined oscillator until the spoofer goes off the air (E4 REF control,
 * gpsdo-reference-mode-set condition).
 *
 * Timeline (scenario clock starts 2027-06-22 16:00:00 UTC):
 * - NAVSTAR-77 (MEO) is high overhead all scenario - no pass to catch
 * - T+7:00  spoofer on the air (gnssThreat spoofStartS + terrestrial event)
 * - T+15:00 spoofer off the air; offset freezes wherever it walked to
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - K0752: Knowledge of system vulnerabilities (threat recognition)
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating communications equipment
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - K1032: Knowledge of satellite-based communication systems
 *   - T0153: Monitor system performance
