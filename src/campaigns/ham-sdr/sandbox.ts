 * Campaign 3 (Backyard Operator) - Sandbox: "Riley's Backyard"
 *
 * Mechanics testbed for the amateur campaign. Guided objectives exercise every
 * new Campaign 3 mechanic end to end (missionType 'Sandbox' keeps it out of
 * campaign progress):
 * - Fixed-gain DIY antennas (QFH / crossed yagi / GPS patch) at VHF/UHF/L-band
 * - Direct-sampling SDR chain (LNB mixer bypass) + SDR Console tab
 * - Circular polarization handedness switch on the crossed yagi
 * - Doppler chasing / AFC on the 70cm FM bird
 * - SatNOGS-style Observations list (pass schedule reskin)
 * - GPS L1 spread-spectrum detection from a MEO bird
 *
 * Pass timeline (scenario clock starts 2027-06-19 16:00:00 UTC):
 * - WXSAT-19:   AOS T+3.0 min, max el 55.0 deg T+10.6, LOS T+18.2 min
 * - CUBEHOP-1:  AOS T+18.0 min, max el 48.2 deg T+24.2, LOS T+30.5 min
 * - NAVSTAR-77: already at el 89 deg, drifts slowly (MEO) - visible all session

  description: `Charlie's niece Riley (KD2RLY) has turned the family backyard in Burlington into a satellite ground station built from scrap: a hand-wound quadrifilar helix on a fence post, a crossed yagi bolted to an old TV rotator, and a GPS patch antenna taped to a paint stick. Total budget: about $80 and one weekend.
  <br/><br/>No mission control, no shift supervisor - just an SDR dongle, a laptop running SkyWatcher, and physics. Everything runs from the SDR Console: tuning, polarization, the rotator, the decoder. Catch a weather satellite with the QFH, chase a cubesat's Doppler on the yagi (mind the polarization switch), and find the GPS constellation hiding under the noise floor.`,
