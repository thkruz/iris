/**
 * ham-sdr Scenario 6 - "The Network Wants Vermont" / tampered-TLE diagnosis
 *
 * Riley's station joins a volunteer observation network, which asks for two
 * contacts tonight: a WXSAT-19 image pass and a CUBEHOP-1 telemetry pass.
 * The wrinkle: the CUBEHOP TLE Riley pulled from a mirror site is TAMPERED
 * (RAAN shifted 60 deg) - the Observations list shows no CUBEHOP pass all
 * afternoon while the network's request sheet promises one. The tell is the
 * disagreement between two sources of truth; the fix is fetching fresh
 * elements (M4 ephemeris panel, reskinned to amateur voice) and catching the
 * bird on the recovered prediction.
 *
 * Engine notes: the scenario's CUBEHOP is a scenario-local instance
 * (makeCubehop1Satellite) and the tamper is applied via spaceEvents[].initialTle
 * on every load - replay-safe, and the roster instance S2-S4 share is never
 * touched. First campaign use of settings.timeSkip (deferred from S4).
 *
 * Timeline (scenario clock starts 2027-06-23 14:40:00 UTC):
 * - WXSAT-19:  AOS 14:50, max el 35.9 deg, LOS 15:04  (network request #1)
 * - CUBEHOP-1: briefed window ~16:59-17:12 at 56.8 deg (network request #2)
 *   - tampered TLE predicts NO CUBEHOP pass this afternoon
 *   - fresh elements restore the 16:59 prediction; timeSkip crosses the gap
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - K0820: Knowledge of supply chain risks
 *   - T0153: Monitor system performance
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - K1032: Knowledge of satellite-based communication systems
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating communications equipment
