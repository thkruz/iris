/**
 * ham-sdr Scenario 8 - "Callsign" / license exam, pirate carrier, first TX,
 * fake beacon epilogue. The campaign finale: the tape comes off the microphone.
 *
 * Four acts on the TX-capable yagi rig (E2) plus the weather rig:
 * 1. License exam - Riley's quiz chain (band plan, control operator, why ham
 *    bands cannot encrypt). No RF until it is passed.
 * 2. Pirate prelude - an unlicensed carrier is being relayed by CUBEHOP-1's
 *    V/U transponder during the afternoon pass. Hear the unauthorized user on
 *    the downlink; understand what makes a transmission authorized.
 * 3. First TX - evening pass: set the uplink to 435.900, key the transmitter,
 *    then tune the receiver to 435.290 and lock your OWN transponded downlink.
 * 4. Fake beacon - after LOS, a "WXSAT-19 beacon" appears on the weather rig
 *    at exactly 137.100 - while no WXSAT pass exists until 23:46. Right
 *    frequency, impossibly strong, zero Doppler, never decodes: physics is
 *    your authentication.
 *
 * Timeline (scenario clock starts 2027-06-26 15:30:00 UTC):
 * - T+20:00 pirate carrier on the CUBEHOP uplink (off again ~16:50)
 * - CUBEHOP-1: AOS 15:55:47, max el 28.9 deg, LOS 16:07:43 (pirate act)
 * - CUBEHOP-1: AOS 17:31:29, max el 25.7 deg, LOS 17:43:24 (first TX)
 * - T+136:40 (~17:46:40) fake WXSAT-19 beacon on the air; the real bird's
 *   next pass is a 2 deg graze at 23:46 - the sky is provably empty
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating communications equipment
 *   - S0648: Skill in detecting anomalies
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - K0740: Knowledge of system performance indicators

RF is unauthenticated; a license is a promise, not a password.<br><br>Then the evening pass: five watts into the crossed yagi, up 435.900, down 435.290, and the strangest signal you will ever chase - your own voice coming back from orbit. Keep the receiver on it through LOS.<br><br>And afterwards, one last visitor proves why everything in this campaign mattered.`,
