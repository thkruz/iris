/**
 * ham-sdr Scenario 3 - "Wrong-Handed" / circular polarization diagnosis
 *
 * Riley re-terminated the yagi's feed harness overnight and the handedness
 * switch was left on LHCP (per the phase-1 retro note: the scenario STARTS
 * wrong-handed). CUBEHOP-1 is RHCP, so the pass opens with the signal ~18 dB
 * in the hole - visible on the waterfall, hopeless to lock. The player has to
 * read the symptom (bird tracked, signal present but weak, C/N in the floor),
 * flip the feed to RHCP (the new antenna-polarization-set condition), and
 * prove it with a >= 10 dB C/N lock through the rest of the pass.
 *
 * Pass timeline (scenario clock starts 2027-06-20 16:24:00 UTC - the next
 * evening; the TLE epoch is 2027-06-19 16:00, well inside SGP4 validity):
 * - CUBEHOP-1: AOS T+4.3 min, max el 63.4 deg at T+10.6, LOS T+17.0 min
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating communications equipment
 *   - K0740: Knowledge of system performance indicators
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - K1032: Knowledge of satellite-based communication systems
 *   - T0153: Monitor system performance
