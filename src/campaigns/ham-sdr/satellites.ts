/**
 * Campaign 3 (Backyard Operator) satellite roster.
 *
 * All receive-only from Riley's backyard: downlinks are direct-transmit
 * "beacons" on transponder configs (no uplink traffic). TLEs are authored
 * against the 2027-06-19 16:00:00 UTC sandbox start with scripts/author-tle.mjs:
 * - WXSAT-19   (137.1 MHz APT):   AOS T+3.0 min, max el 55.0 deg T+10.6, LOS T+18.2
 * - CUBEHOP-1  (435.25 MHz FM):   AOS T+18.0 min, max el 48.2 deg T+24.2, LOS T+30.5
 * - NAVSTAR-77 (1575.42 MHz L1):  MEO, el 89.3 deg at T+0, still 62.2 deg at T+60 min
 *
 * Downlink powers are calibrated from real EIRPs against the fixed-gain
 * antenna model (QFH 3 dBi / crossed yagi 12 dBi / patch 5 dBi) for mid-pass
 * C/N around 20-25 dB; validate live in-app before shipping scored scenarios.
