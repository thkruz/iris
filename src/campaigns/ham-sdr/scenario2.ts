/**
 * ham-sdr Scenario 2 - "The Slippery Bird" / manual Doppler chase on the yagi
 *
 * The yagi and its TV rotator enter the campaign. CUBEHOP-1's 435.25 MHz FM
 * downlink drifts +/-10 kHz across the pass - more than the 15 kHz channel can
 * swallow - so the operator must ride the VFO with the tune buttons for the
 * whole pass. AFC exists and is deliberately forbidden: the chase objective
 * asserts receiver-afc-enabled { afcEnabled: false } while the lock is held
 * (Riley: "I make everyone do it by hand once"). Scenario 4 pays this off.
 *
 * Pass timeline (scenario clock starts 2027-06-19 16:14:00 UTC - the same
 * evening as Scenario 1, one bird later):
 * - CUBEHOP-1: AOS T+4.0 min, max el 48.2 deg at T+10.2, LOS T+16.5 min
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating communications equipment
 *   - K1032: Knowledge of satellite-based communication systems
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - K0740: Knowledge of system performance indicators
 *   - T0153: Monitor system performance
