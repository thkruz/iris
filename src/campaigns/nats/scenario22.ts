/**
 * NATS Level 22: "End-of-Life Planning"
 *
 * Phase: Crisis Operations (Phase 3, Scenario 6 of 8)
 * Time Pressure: None - this is analysis and communication
 * Calculation Required: Light (trend extrapolation, no RF math)
 * Mechanic Reused: the Working Document panel (from S19), now producing an
 *   executive impact assessment rather than a how-to card.
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - K0721: Knowledge of risk management principles and practices
 *   - T1429: Prepare trend analysis reports
 *   - T1606: Prepare impact reports
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - K0751: Knowledge of system threats
 *   - S0807: Skill in solving problems
 *   - T1020: Determine operational and safety impacts
 *
 * Premise: AURORA-7's beacon power has declined for months (power subsystem
 * aging) and the decline is steepening. Francis Martin (board) wants an
 * operations recommendation on retirement timing. The player runs a final
 * data-collection pass, then builds a trend assessment and sunset
 * recommendation in the Working Document - the campaign's first
 * report-producing scenario. Light on RF, heavy on analysis and the
 * discipline of labeling confidence.
 *
 * Tone: Reflective-analytical. Marcus (Halifax vehicle view), Dana (intro),
 * Francis (board-level, rare). All quizzes SYSTEM. 5 clips.
 *
 * Sim notes:
 *   - AURORA-7 starts on program-track; player engages step-track for the
 *     final ops run (the beacon is weak - end-of-life). The data-collection
 *     phase is real; the rest is analysis quizzes that build the report.

For your trend: our vehicle telemetry shows the array down to about seventy percent of beginning-of-life output, and the bus is auto-shedding RF load to protect the housekeeping buses. Your beacon decline and our power numbers are the same story. She's earned her retirement, eh.

          Francis Martin. Appreciate you taking this on directly. What the board needs is exactly what you're building - not a date we'll have to walk back, but a window with triggers we can plan a migration around. Cost-of-being-wrong runs both directions here: retire too early and we waste an asset, too late and we strand customers. Give me the honest middle.

          First report you've written that goes straight to a board instead of into a shift log. Notice it's the same discipline as a good log entry - say what you know, label what you don't, make the next reader able to act. Scales all the way up.
