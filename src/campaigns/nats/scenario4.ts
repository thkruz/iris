        Hey there, this is Marcus Chen from Halifax spacecraft ops. TIDEMARK-2's station-keeping is looking good - we finished the last maneuver sequence yesterday and the payload's been handed over to ground ops. She's all yours now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry for the short notice on this one. The bird came online about a week ahead of schedule, but that's a good problem to have. Charlie tells me you've been making solid progress, so I'm confident you can handle the switchover.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mission brief has all the details - frequencies, look angles, everything you need. ME-02's got primary on TIDEMARK-1, so there's no customer impact while you work. Take your time, be methodical, and give me a shout when you've got lock. I'll be watching the payload telemetry from our end.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing to remember: TIDEMARK-2 is at a different orbital slot than TIDEMARK-1, so your look angles and frequencies will all be different. Don't just copy what worked for the other bird. Think through each step.

          VT-01 is currently locked on TIDEMARK-1 at azimuth 161.8, elevation 34.2. TIDEMARK-2 is about 58 degrees away in azimuth, at a lower elevation - that's a significant slew across the sky.

          The antenna is in program-track mode, following ephemeris predictions. That's typical for GEO satellites - they sit in essentially the same spot, so we follow the math rather than actively hunting for peak signal.
        </p>

          That was a big move - about 58 degrees in azimuth and 8 degrees in elevation. Takes a minute or two for a dish this size to cover that distance safely. The ACU limits slew rate to prevent mechanical stress.
        </p>

          Exactly. TIDEMARK-1 is at 53 West, TIDEMARK-2 is at 45 West. That's 8 degrees of orbital separation along the Clarke belt. From our perspective here in Vermont, that translates to the angular change you just saw.
        </p>

          Every satellite has its own unique look angles from any given ground station. That's why we use program-track with proper ephemeris data instead of just copying numbers from another site.

        <p>
          Think about it: wrong pointing means no signal at all. Wrong LO frequency means the beacon appears at a different IF. Seeing it where you calculated proves both are correct.
