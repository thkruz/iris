/**
 * NATS Level 13: "Thermal Anomaly"
 *
 * Phase: Qualified Operations (Phase 2, Scenario 5 of 8)
 *
 * Premise: Mid-shift. VT-01 is up on TIDEMARK-1 carrying normal customer
 * traffic. The BUC temperature has been creeping upward for the last
 * ~15 minutes: 57°C -> 62°C with a steady ~+0.3°C/min slope. No alarm
 * (the over-temperature trip is at 70°C). BUC current draw is also
 * elevated (4.1A vs nominal ~3.0A). Everything else on the station is
 * nominal: GPSDO locked, RX beacon clean, antenna locked, HPA backoff
 * 8 dB and not overdriven.
 *
 * The trend signature points at one root cause: BUC gain is sitting at
 * 33 dB - 10 dB above the 23 dB operating value (same class of leftover
 * the S12 maintenance crew taught us to look for). The BUC is dissipating
 * the excess as heat into its own chassis. The right call is to de-rate
 * (reduce BUC gain back to 23 dB) which preserves carrier within SLA
 * margin, lets the BUC cool, and buys time for a planned swap.
 *
 * Alternative responses (swap now, mute and switch to backup, hold and
 * monitor) are not wrong - they're just costlier than necessary for a
 * pre-alarm trend. The lesson is judgment under uncertainty, not a
 * checklist.
 *
 * Tone: Qualified operator. Dana texts the trend flag at the start,
 * checks in once at the decision point, acknowledges the action, and
 * signs off. All knowledge checks are SYSTEM.
