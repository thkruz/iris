/**
 * NATS Level 3: "Weather Emergency Handover"
 *
 * Phase: Introduction (Phase 1, Scenario 3 of 8)
 * Time Pressure: Moderate (snow already falling, 15 minutes before link unusable)
 * Calculation Required: NO - all values provided by Charlie
 * New UI Elements: Ground station switcher, multi-site monitoring, AGC observation
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - T0153: Monitor network capacity and performance
 *   - K0689: Knowledge of network infrastructure principles and practices
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating network equipment
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - K0645: Knowledge of standard operating procedures (SOPs)
 *   - K0740: Knowledge of system performance indicators
 *   - K0741: Knowledge of system availability measures
 *   - K0770: Knowledge of system administration concepts (handover procedures)
 *   - K0773: Knowledge of telecommunications principles and practices
 *   - K0792: Knowledge of network configurations
 *   - K1032: Knowledge of satellite-based communication systems and software
 *   - T0431: Check system hardware availability, functionality, integrity, and efficiency
 *
 * Premise: Heavy snow is already falling on Vermont. The link margin is degrading
 * and will drop below operational threshold within 15 minutes. You need to bring
 * the Maine backup station online, configure it to match Vermont's parameters,
 * verify signal acquisition, and execute a clean traffic handover before the
 * Vermont link becomes unusable.
 *
 * Key Learning Objectives:
 * 1. Understand weather protection (feed heater) and why it matters
 * 2. Navigate between multiple ground stations in the asset tree
 * 3. Understand AGC and how it compensates for signal degradation
 * 4. Configure a backup site to match primary site parameters
 * 5. Verify beacon acquisition on spectrum analyzer before trusting modem lock
 * 6. Execute traffic handover with service continuity
 * 7. Protect equipment during severe weather (antenna stow)
 *
 * Character Notes:
 *   - Charlie Brooks: Urgent but controlled. Weather handovers are routine but
 *     time-critical. He's done dozens of these but needs you to execute correctly.
 *   - Catherine Vega: Maine station operator, arriving mid-scenario. Professional,
 *     helpful, will take over once handover is complete.
