/**
 * NATS Level 21: "Hostile RF"
 *
 * Phase: Crisis Operations (Phase 3, Scenario 5 of 8)
 * Time Pressure: Moderate - the interferer is active and intermittent
 * Calculation Required: NO (guard-band reasoning, no RF math)
 * New Mechanic: time-windowed interference (engine: InterferenceManager
 *   injects a duty-cycled jammer at the satellite transponder, so it is
 *   relayed to the receiving station - the uplink-interference case that
 *   makes discrimination meaningful).
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - K0926: Knowledge of signal jamming tools and techniques
 *   - S0615: Skill in protecting a network against malware
 *   - S0648: Skill in detecting anomalies
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - T0081: Diagnose network connectivity problems
 *   - S0593: Skill in handling incidents
 *   - T0153: Monitor network capacity and performance
 *   - K0751: Knowledge of system threats
 *
 * Premise: An intermittent, broadband-ish interferer rides the TIDEMARK-2
 * downlink - on/off in a regular pattern that fits neither cross-pol leakage
 * nor known terrestrial sources. The operator characterizes the signature,
 * discriminates deliberate jamming from accidental interference (duty cycle,
 * transponder-vs-local, data-layer integrity), applies receive-side
 * mitigation, builds the regulator package, and - critically - verifies this
 * is RF-layer denial and NOT a data-layer intrusion (crypto/key integrity).
 *
 * The campaign's first adversarial-aware scenario, deepened: a rigorous
 * jamming-vs-interference workflow that maps onto real ITU interference-
 * reporting practice and the denial-vs-intrusion distinction.
 *
 * Tone: Crisis-phase, investigative. Dana (incident handling), Marcus
 * (spacecraft-side consultation), regulator rendered as SYSTEM notifications.
 * All quizzes SYSTEM. 5-6 clips.
 *
 * Sim notes:
 *   - interferenceEvents: duty-cycled jammer on TM-2 (NORAD 61526) at uplink
 *     6005 MHz H-pol (inside TP-1 passband 5999-6035) -> relayed to downlink
 *     3780 MHz -> 1470 MHz IF at ME-02 (LNB LO 5250). Carrier sits at 1458
 *     MHz IF; the jammer is ~12 MHz off, characterizable on a wide span.
 *   - 90 s on / 60 s off, repeating - the regular duty cycle IS the
 *     deliberation signature.
 *   - Crypto defaults ACTIVE/Valid: the data-layer checks pass, proving the
 *     attack is RF denial, not intrusion. (If they ever changed mid-incident,
 *     the scenario's whole posture would change - that is the teaching point.)

  description: `Catherine's day shift flagged it before she left: intermittent broadband noise riding the TIDEMARK-2 downlink, on-off-on, gone before she could characterize it. It's back this morning. It doesn't match the cross-pol neighbors and it doesn't match weather.<br><br>Treat it as an interference incident from the first minute. Characterize the signature, discriminate jamming from a benign accident, mitigate what you can on the receive side, and build the regulator package as you go. And verify the half of this that matters most: an RF interferer denies your signal - it does not touch your data. Prove the data layer is intact, or you are no longer working an interference event.<br><br>If it turns out to be somebody's misaligned uplink, the same evidence resolves it. If it's deliberate, the evidence IS the response.`,
