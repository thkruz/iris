/**
 * NATS Level 5: "Interference Hunt"
 *
 * Phase: Intermediate
 * Time Pressure: Moderate
 * Calculation Required: None (guided analysis)
 * Focus: Spectrum analysis, interference identification, notch filter mitigation
 *
 * Premise: Customer reports degraded service on TIDEMARK-1. C/N ratio has dropped
 * because of a 3 MHz interference spike WITHIN our 36 MHz signal bandwidth. This is
 * caused by a third-party operator's polarization mismatch - their cross-pol leakage
 * is landing in our transponder. The AGC is reducing gain based on the spike, which
 * degrades overall C/N.
 *
 * Solution: Apply a 3 MHz notch filter at the interference frequency to block the
 * spike while passing the rest of our 36 MHz signal.
 *
 * Flow:
 * 1. Navigate to station and review mission brief
 * 2. Navigate to receiver and observe degraded C/N
 * 3. Understand the full impact of the degradation
 * 4. Navigate to spectrum analyzer and understand its current configuration
 * 5. Configure spectrum view (widen span, center on downlink IF)
 * 6. Identify and characterize the interference
 * 7. Record the interference frequency
 * 8. Understand cross-polarization cause
 * 9. Understand AGC impact mechanism
 * 10. Evaluate mitigation options
 * 11. Navigate to filter bank and configure notch filter
 * 12. Verify interference removed on spectrum
 * 13. Verify C/N restored
 * 14. Understand documentation requirements

        I checked the basics - antenna is tracking fine, LNB is powered, no alarms on the RF chain. But I haven't had time to dig into the signal quality yet. The spectrum analyzer was last configured for beacon tracking, so you'll need to reconfigure it to see the actual customer signal.

        This is a priority customer - they're using this link for critical vessel communications in the North Atlantic. The SLA clock is ticking, so let's work efficiently but thoroughly. Read the mission brief to get the full picture, then let me know when you're ready to start troubleshooting.

        <p>
          Now we need to understand the full impact. A degraded C/N doesn't happen in isolation - it affects the entire receive chain. Think about what other symptoms you'd expect to see when the demodulator is struggling with a poor signal.

          Exactly right. Degraded C/N means the demodulator is making bit errors because it can't clearly distinguish the signal from the noise. Those bit errors propagate up the stack as packet errors, which is exactly what the customer is seeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to fix this, we need to understand what's causing the C/N to drop. Time to look at the spectrum. The spectrum analyzer is currently set up for beacon observation, so you'll need to reconfigure it to see our main carrier.

          Right. Beacon observation uses a narrow span because beacons are themselves narrowband - just a few kilohertz. We only need to see enough spectrum to capture the beacon and verify it's there.

        <p>
          But our customer signal is wideband - 36 megahertz of QPSK-modulated data. To see what's happening to that signal, we need to widen the span to at least 50 megahertz, and re-center on the signal's IF frequency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, the receiver modem is tuned to 1,532 megahertz IF - that's where you'll find the main signal.

          Good. Now we can see the bigger picture. With a wider span and proper center frequency, you should be able to see our full wideband carrier - the 36 megahertz signal should be clearly visible as a raised plateau of energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          But look carefully within that bandwidth. There's something else in there that shouldn't be. In-band interference is the worst kind because you can't just filter it out with a narrower passband - it's sitting right on top of your wanted signal.

          You found it. That spike is classic in-band interference. It's not adjacent to our signal - it's inside it. That's what makes it so problematic. We can't just tighten our bandpass to exclude it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we need to characterize it. Look at the spike compared to our wideband signal. How does its bandwidth compare? Understanding the interference signature will tell us a lot about what's causing it and how to fix it.

          It's narrowband - just a spike compared to our 36 megahertz wideband carrier. That's actually good news for us. A narrowband interferer means we can potentially use a notch filter to surgically remove it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we apply any mitigation, we need to identify where this spike is sitting. Look at the spectrum display and estimate the center frequency of the interference. That's the target for our notch filter.

          Right - 1,515 megahertz IF. That's our target frequency. Now let's figure out what's causing this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think about what could put a narrowband signal inside our transponder bandwidth. We're using horizontal polarization on this transponder. Satellite transponders often have matching transponders on the orthogonal polarization for frequency reuse - another operator might be using that vertical pol slot.

        <p>
          Cross-polarization interference. Satellites use orthogonal polarizations to double capacity - you can have two signals on the same frequency, one horizontal and one vertical. In theory, they're completely isolated from each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, nothing's perfect. Antenna feeds have finite cross-pol isolation, typically 25 to 35 dB. Rain, ice, and Faraday rotation in the ionosphere can degrade polarization purity further. The result is leakage between polarizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another operator's signal on V-pol is leaking into our H-pol. But here's the puzzle - that spike is narrow, yet it's degrading our entire wideband signal. Think about how the receiver's AGC works.
        </p>

          Exactly. The AGC measures total power in the IF passband and adjusts gain to keep the signal level optimal for the demodulator. It doesn't know the difference between wanted signal and interference - it just sees power.
        </p>
        <p>
          That spike adds power to the passband. The AGC responds by reducing gain. But reducing gain affects everything - including our wanted carrier. So even though the interference is narrowband, it degrades C/N across our entire wideband signal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we know the problem. The question is: what's the best way to fix it? We have several options available.

          Right - a notch filter is the surgical solution. We configure it at exactly 1,515 megahertz with just enough bandwidth to cover the spike - probably 1 megahertz or so. The filter attenuates that narrow slice while passing the rest of our 36 megahertz signal untouched.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the spike removed, the AGC will see only our wanted signal power and set the gain appropriately. C/N should recover.
        </p>
        <p>
          Head to the IF Filter Bank to configure the notch. Set the center frequency to 1,515 megahertz, bandwidth to 1 megahertz, and depth to at least 40 dB. That should be enough to suppress the interference below the noise floor.

          Good - the notch filter is configured. Let's verify it's working. Head back to the spectrum analyzer and look at where the spike was. If the notch is properly placed, that spike should be gone or severely attenuated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, the notch filter is a receive-side fix. It doesn't eliminate the interference at the source - it just prevents our receiver from seeing it. The other operator's signal is still there on V-pol, but our filter is blocking the leakage from affecting our equipment.

          The spike is gone from our view. The notch filter is attenuating that frequency by 40 dB, which pushes the interference power well below the noise floor. Our spectrum shows a clean wideband signal now.
        </p>
        <p>
          But spectrum is only half the story. The real test is whether the receiver's performance has improved. Check the receiver modem to see if C/N has recovered.

          C/N is back to normal operating levels. The AGC is no longer being fooled by the interference spike, so it's setting the gain correctly for our wanted signal. The customer should see their packet errors clear up immediately.

          Nice work. You diagnosed a non-obvious interference problem, understood the mechanism behind it, and applied the right mitigation. That's the kind of systematic troubleshooting that separates good operators from great ones.

          One more thing - this kind of event needs to be properly documented for the long-term fix.

          Perfect. I'll file a coordination request with the satellite operator to track down the source of the cross-pol interference. With the frequency, bandwidth, and timing information you've gathered, they can identify which uplink is causing the problem and work with that operator to improve their polarization alignment.
        </p>

          Meanwhile, the notch filter gives us a solid workaround. The customer is back online, the SLA is intact, and we have a path to the root cause fix.

          This is exactly how professional interference mitigation works - quick restoration of service, followed by proper documentation and coordination to prevent recurrence. Well done.
