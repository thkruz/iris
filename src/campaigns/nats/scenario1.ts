/**
 * NATS Level 1: "First Day" - TIDEMARK-1 Health Check
 *
 * Phase: Introduction (Phase 1, Scenario 1 of 8)
 * Time Pressure: None (tutorial pacing)
 * Calculation Required: NO - observation and familiarization only
 * New UI Elements: All panels introduced - asset tree, tabs, equipment displays
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - K0740: Knowledge of system performance indicators
 *   - K0741: Knowledge of system availability measures
 *   - T0153: Monitor network capacity and performance
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - K0645: Knowledge of standard operating procedures (SOPs)
 *   - K0773: Knowledge of telecommunications principles and practices
 *   - K1032: Knowledge of satellite-based communication systems and software
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating network equipment
 *   - T0431: Check system hardware availability, functionality, integrity, and efficiency
 *
 * Premise: First day at North Atlantic Teleport Services. Charlie Brooks, senior
 * operator transferring to Europe next month, walks you through a routine health
 * check on TIDEMARK-1. This is observation and familiarization - learn what each
 * panel shows, what the indicators mean, and what "normal" looks like.
 *
 * Key Learning Objectives:
 * 1. Navigate the ground station UI (asset tree, tabs)
 * 2. Identify key equipment panels (GPSDO, LNB, HPA, Spectrum Analyzer, Modems)
 * 3. Understand what "normal" readings look like for each system
 * 4. Learn the systematic health check workflow (timing → RX → TX → antenna → alarms)
 * 5. Build foundation for independent operations in later scenarios
 *
 * Character Notes:
 *   - Charlie Brooks: Senior operator, 6 years experience, transferring soon.
 *     Direct, efficient, no-nonsense. Won't repeat himself but the system will.
 *     Wants to get you up to speed quickly before he leaves.

        Good. The Tap Points card tells you where in the signal chain the spectrum analyzer takes its input. RX IF means you're looking at the receive path after the LNB downconverts from RF - that's what you want for monitoring the downlink. TX IF would show you the transmit side before it goes to the BUC.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a health check, RX IF is the standard choice. Now let's move to the spectrum analyzer.

        You're looking for the beacon - TIDEMARK-1's CW carrier. It's already configured to show it. Should be a clean spike above the noise floor. If you don't see it, check the center frequency. Beacon IF is 1074.5 MHz after the LNB downconverts from RF.
      </p>
      <p>
        There it is. Clean beacon. That carrier is your canary - if you can see it, the receive path is working. If it disappears or goes ragged, something changed. Could be weather, could be equipment, could be the satellite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now check the analyzer settings. Center frequency and reference level determine what you're actually looking at.

        1074.5 center, span set to 2kHz. That's the setup for beacon watch. Get these wrong and you're either staring at the wrong frequency or your signal's buried in the noise floor. I've seen new ops spend an hour troubleshooting a "missing" signal that was just off-screen. Don't be that person.

        Good margin. That headroom is what keeps you online when a storm rolls through or the satellite has a bad day. C/N is your primary health metric - know it, watch it, respect it.

      <p>
        Last thing on the receive side - the constellation diagram. Visual representation of the demodulated symbols.
      </p>
      <p>
        QPSK gives you four clusters, one per symbol. Tight clusters mean clean demod. Scattered means noise. Rotating means phase problems. Empty means no lock.

        Tight clusters. That's the picture of a healthy link. After a while you'll glance at that diagram and know instantly if something's off. Noise spreads the points, phase errors rotate them, interference makes them dance.

        One more thing on the receive side - scroll down to the Payload Data Integrity card. This shows you the data path after demodulation. Frame sync, error correction, decryption status - the whole pipeline.

        One thing - never assume the HPA is muted. I've seen guys reach into the waveguide thinking RF was off. It wasn't. Always verify.

        Next is polarization - how the wave is oriented. Has to match what the satellite expects or you lose signal. Could be horizontal at 0 degrees, vertical at 90, or something in between.
