/**
 * NATS Level 2: "Scheduled Maintenance" - Power Down and Recovery Procedures
 *
 * Phase: Introduction (Phase 1, Scenario 2 of 8)
 * Time Pressure: Moderate (maintenance window constraint)
 * Calculation Required: NO - all values provided by Charlie
 * New UI Elements: Equipment power controls, modem transmit controls, antenna positioning
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - T1567: Configure system hardware, software, and peripheral equipment
 *   - K0770: Knowledge of system administration principles and practices
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating network equipment
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - K0645: Knowledge of standard operating procedures (SOPs)
 *   - K0773: Knowledge of telecommunications principles and practices
 *   - K1032: Knowledge of satellite-based communication systems and software
 *   - K0740: Knowledge of system performance indicators
 *   - K0741: Knowledge of system availability measures
 *   - T0153: Monitor network capacity and performance
 *   - T0431: Check system hardware availability, functionality, integrity, and efficiency
 *   - S0077: Skill in securing network communications (RF safety)
 *
 * Premise: The maintenance crew needs to perform work on the TIDEMARK-1 antenna
 * feed assembly. You'll execute proper power-down sequencing to ensure RF safety,
 * move the antenna to maintenance position, then restore full service afterward.
 *
 * Key Learning Objectives:
 * 1. Understand RF safety protocols and why sequence matters
 * 2. Execute proper HPA → BUC → LNB power-down sequence
 * 3. Command antenna to maintenance position
 * 4. Execute proper LNB → BUC → HPA power-up sequence (reverse order)
 * 5. Verify link restoration via beacon signal
 *
 * Character Notes:
 *   - Charlie Brooks: More hands-off this time. You touched controls yesterday,
 *     now prove you can execute procedures correctly. He'll provide values but
 *     expects you to know which controls to use.

          Check the spectrum analyzer. TIDEMARK-1's beacon should be visible at 1,074.5 MHz on the IF side. That's 4,175.5 MHz RF minus our 5,250 MHz LO. If you see a clean carrier there, we're pointed correctly.

          Quick question - you're seeing 1,074.5 MHz on the spectrum analyzer. The satellite transmits at 4,175.5 MHz. How does the math work?

          Right. LO minus RF equals IF. Basic downconversion. You'll be doing that calculation a lot.

          Now we can restore transmit. Click the TX Chain tab. Start the modem transmitting first, then power on the BUC - we bring up low-power stages before high-power ones.
