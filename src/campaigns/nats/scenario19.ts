/**
 * NATS Level 19: "Train the New Hire"
 *
 * Phase: Crisis Operations (Phase 3, Scenario 3 of 8)
 * Time Pressure: None - teaching is the work
 * Calculation Required: YES - the card's numbers must be derived correctly
 * New Mechanic: the Working Document panel. Each teaching quiz carries a
 *   params.documentLine; correct answers append to the in-game quick-reference
 *   card the player is producing. The deliverable is visible and reviewable.
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - T1411: Deliver technical training to customers
 *   - T1334: Produce cybersecurity instructional materials
 *   - K0645: Knowledge of standard operating procedures (SOPs)
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - T1567: Configure system hardware, software, peripheral equipment
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating network equipment
 *   - K0773: Knowledge of telecommunications principles and practices
 *
 * Premise: Dana wants a one-page AURORA-7 acquisition/track quick-reference
 * card for an incoming new hire - written by someone who flies the procedure,
 * not copied from a vendor manual. The player performs the live procedure
 * end-to-end and, at each step, chooses which callout, formula, or
 * common-mistake warning belongs on the card. Correct choices build the card
 * in the Working Document panel.
 *
 * The deeper lesson: executing a procedure and knowing which three of its
 * fifty steps a new operator will get wrong are different skills. This is the
 * campaign's mentoring beat - the player must articulate the WHY.
 *
 * Tone: Reflective-operational. Dana intro + acknowledgment only (3 clips).
 * All quizzes SYSTEM. The new hire never appears on screen.
