/**
 * NATS Level 20: "Dual Outage"
 *
 * Phase: Crisis Operations (Phase 3, Scenario 4 of 8)
 * Time Pressure: High - both sites degrading simultaneously
 * Calculation Required: NO - this is triage and parallel recovery
 * New Value: true multi-SITE prioritization (S16 was one site, many faults;
 *   S20 is two sites, unrelated root causes) plus the campaign's first
 *   explicit adversarial-awareness beat: "two at once - coincidence or
 *   attack?" answered with evidence, not vibes.
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - T1144: Implement network backup and recovery procedures
 *   - S0671: Skill in implementing contingency and recovery plans
 *   - S0807: Skill in solving problems
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - T1538: Resolve customer-reported system incidents
 *   - S0593: Skill in handling incidents
 *   - T0531: Troubleshoot hardware/software interoperability problems
 *   - K0751: Knowledge of system threats
 *
 * Premise: A winter storm is icing VT-01's feed (the inherited failure: the
 * heater was left off ahead of the front) while ME-02 simultaneously throws an
 * HPA overdrive with an over-temperature alarm (back-off drifted to 1 dB).
 * Dana is 40 minutes out. The operator triages: start VT's slow recovery (one
 * switch - heater on), work ME's dangerous-but-deterministic fault end to end,
 * then verify both recoveries and document why simultaneity was coincidence.
 *
 * Triage logic taught: a slow recovery you can START costs nothing to start
 * first; a dangerous fast fault gets your full attention immediately after;
 * verification happens in the order recoveries complete.
 *
 * Sim notes:
 *   - VT-01: 'snow'/severe weather event from T=0; heater OFF (vermont
 *     default) so ice accumulates (~10 dB max, tau 720 s). Heater ON melts
 *     at 1 dB/min. Ice recovery checked via custom evaluator.
 *   - ME-02: HPA backOff 1 -> isOverdriven; temperature recomputed from
 *     output power each tick, so restoring back-off clears the thermal alarm
 *     deterministically. BUC stays unmuted throughout (RF-safety rule).
