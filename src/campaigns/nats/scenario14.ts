/**
 * NATS Level 14: "Rain Fade"
 *
 * Phase: Qualified Operations (Phase 2, Scenario 6 of 8)
 * Time Pressure: Moderate (rain front arriving early in the scenario)
 * Calculation Required: NO
 * New UI Elements: None - reuses S3 (feed heater + AGC) and S1 (C/N margin)
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - K0689: Knowledge of network infrastructure principles and practices
 *   - S0675: Skill in optimizing system performance
 *   - K0721: Knowledge of risk management principles and practices
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - T0153: Monitor network capacity and performance
 *   - K0773: Knowledge of telecommunications principles and practices
 *   - S0593: Skill in handling incidents
 *
 * Premise: Light to moderate rain is moving over VT-01. The customer
 * (James Okafor, SeaLink fleet captain) has called ahead - their SLA
 * terms allow degradation but penalize handover events. He wants the
 * operator to hold VT-01 through the weather if at all possible.
 *
 * The operator's job: enable feed heater, watch AGC headroom, monitor
 * link margin, and make the call - hold or hand off. The right answer
 * for a moderate rain front is to hold; the wrong answer is to escape
 * the moment the link wavers.
 *
 * S3 taught "weather hits → hand over." S14 teaches that escape is not
 * always correct. Customer-constraint reasoning is explicit, and this
 * is the first scenario in the campaign that introduces K0721 (risk
 * management) as a primary code.
 *
 * Tone: Qualified operator. Dialog capped at 4 clips. SYSTEM for all
 * quizzes by default. Named characters only for the customer call,
 * the decision check-in, and the close.
 *
 * Story Continuity:
 *   - Dana is on-site, primary supervisor.
 *   - ME-02 has been running TIDEMARK-2 since S3 - available as fallback
 *     but currently busy with its own customers.
 *   - James Okafor speaks the customer-impact side; he doesn't talk RF.
