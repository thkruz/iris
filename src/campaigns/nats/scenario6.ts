/**
 * NATS Level 6: "Old Faithful"
 *
 * Phase: Intermediate (first intermediate scenario)
 * Time Pressure: Moderate (30-minute scenario timer)
 * Calculation Required: YES - TX IF frequency calculation (uplink, for variety)
 * New UI Elements: Step-track mode, encryption/payload cards awareness
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - K1032: Knowledge of satellite-based communication systems
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating network equipment
 *   - T0153: Monitor network capacity and performance
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - K0773: Knowledge of telecommunications principles and practices
 *   - S0077: Skill in securing network communications
 *   - K0740: Knowledge of system performance indicators
 *   - T1567: Equipment configuration happens throughout
 *
 * Premise: This is a training exercise to practice step-track mode on AURORA-7,
 * a legacy satellite with an inclined orbit. Charlie Brooks has pre-configured
 * the encryption and payload settings - the student just needs to understand
 * what they do.
 *
 * Key Learning Objectives:
 * 1. Understand why inclined orbits require step-track
 * 2. Enable step-track mode and achieve beacon lock (beacon pre-configured)
 * 3. Configure RX modem for downlink reception
 * 4. Understand encryption and payload card functions
 * 5. Calculate TX IF frequency (uplink calculation - adds curriculum variety)
 * 6. Configure TX modem and enable transmit path
 *
 * Technical Reference (AURORA-7):
 *   - Uplink RF: 5830 MHz
 *   - Downlink RF: 3605 MHz
 *   - Beacon RF: 4165 MHz
 *   - LNB LO: 5250 MHz
 *   - Beacon IF: 1085 MHz (5250 - 4165) - PRE-CONFIGURED by Charlie
 *   - Downlink IF: 1422 MHz (5250 - 3828)
 *   - BUC LO: 7500 MHz
 *   - TX IF: 1447 MHz (5830 - 7500) - STUDENT CALCULATES THIS
 *   - Bandwidth: 24 MHz
 *
 * Key Differences from Scenario 4:
 *   - Uses step-track mode (not program-track)
 *   - No tab-active conditions - student navigates independently
 *   - Quiz-heavy for conceptual understanding
 *   - Training narrative - lower stakes, focus on learning

  description: `AURORA-7 is a legacy C-band satellite that's been in service for over 15 years. To conserve fuel, the operators stopped north-south station-keeping, so the orbit is now inclined. The satellite traces a figure-8 pattern in the sky - you can't just point and forget.<br><br>This is a training exercise to practice step-track mode. Unlike program-track which follows predicted orbital elements, step-track uses the beacon signal to continuously adjust antenna pointing. It's essential for tracking satellites with inclined orbits.<br><br>Charlie has pre-configured the beacon frequency, encryption, and payload settings. Your job is to acquire the satellite using step-track, establish receive lock, calculate the TX IF frequency, and bring up the transmit path.<br><br>Take your time - this is practice.`,

      <p>
        Today's a training day. We're going to practice step-track on AURORA-7 - she's an old bird with an inclined orbit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike the TIDEMARK satellites which sit in nice geostationary slots, AURORA-7 drifts north and south throughout the day. Program-track won't cut it because the orbital predictions aren't accurate enough. You need step-track.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step-track uses the beacon signal to continuously adjust antenna pointing. The algorithm hunts for maximum signal, making small adjustments to keep the antenna optimized.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've already configured the beacon frequency, encryption, and payload settings. Your job is to get the antenna tracking, establish receive lock, and configure the transmit path. You'll need to calculate the TX IF frequency yourself. Take your time - this is practice.

          That's why we need step-track - it actively follows the beacon signal instead of relying on predictions. I've already configured the beacon frequency at 1,085 megahertz IF. Let's verify that configuration before switching modes.
