/**
 * NATS Level 17: "Solar Event"
 *
 * Phase: Crisis Operations (Phase 3, Scenario 1 of 8)
 * Time Pressure: The transit window is fixed - the clock is astronomy's, not ours
 * Calculation Required: NO
 * New Mechanic: sun-transit weather event (engine: skyNoiseDegradation on the
 *   RX path, rise-peak-fall profile, RX-only)
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - K0751: Knowledge of system threats
 *   - T1020: Determine operational and safety impacts
 *   - K0689: Knowledge of network infrastructure principles and practices
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - T0153: Monitor network capacity and performance
 *   - K1032: Knowledge of satellite-based communication systems
 *   - S0593: Skill in handling incidents
 *
 * Premise: The semiannual sun transit window on TIDEMARK-1 from VT-01. The Sun
 * crosses the antenna boresight for ~5 minutes, raising the system noise
 * temperature until the demodulator briefly loses the carrier. The event is
 * predicted, contractually excused (with advance notice), and unfixable.
 *
 * The first Phase 3 lesson inverts every prior scenario: the right answer is to
 * accept degradation. Notify before, hold configuration during, verify and
 * document after. The only failure modes are panic actions and a late
 * notification.
 *
 * Tone: Crisis-phase operational. Dana briefing + sign-off, Marcus one
 * spacecraft-side confirmation. All quizzes SYSTEM. 4 clips.
 *
 * Sim notes:
 *   - weatherEvents 'sun-transit': starts T+300s, 300s duration, 12 dB peak.
 *     Profile sin^2 -> degradation >6 dB roughly T+375..525s, clear by ~T+585s.
 *   - 12 dB peak takes beacon and carrier C/N below threshold: demod genuinely
 *     unlocks near peak and self-recovers. Uplink is unaffected by design.
 *   - Custom-evaluator conditions read skyNoiseDegradation_dB via the
 *     window.signalRange handle (no imports - avoids manager import cycles).
