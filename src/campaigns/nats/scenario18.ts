/**
 * NATS Level 18: "Satellite Anomaly"
 *
 * Phase: Crisis Operations (Phase 3, Scenario 2 of 8)
 * Time Pressure: Moderate - the drift grows while you decide
 * Calculation Required: NO
 * New Mechanic: a scenario-local DRIFTING variant of TIDEMARK-2 (same bird,
 *   same NORAD ID, same frequency plan - but with station-keeping suspended:
 *   inclined-orbit figure-8 drift and a stale ephemeris). First scenario where
 *   the satellite itself, not the ground segment, is the unknown.
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - K1032: Knowledge of satellite-based communication systems
 *   - T1314: Maintain network infrastructure
 *   - K0751: Knowledge of system threats
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - K0721: Knowledge of risk management principles and practices
 *   - T0153: Monitor network capacity and performance
 *   - S0593: Skill in handling incidents
 *
 * Premise: Halifax reports TIDEMARK-2's north-south station-keeping thrusters
 * are degraded and burns are suspended. Residual inclination is building - the
 * bird traces a growing daily figure-8 the stale ephemeris no longer predicts.
 * Program-track is bleeding C/N. The operator (covering ME-02) must recognize
 * the signature, transition to step-track, hold the link, and feed the
 * spacecraft team ground-side observations - while staying inside the ground
 * role: Halifax flies the vehicle; we keep the lock.
 *
 * Tone: Crisis-phase. Marcus is the primary voice (spacecraft side), Dana
 * provides incident support. All quizzes SYSTEM. 6 clips.
 *
 * Sim notes:
 *   - The drifting TM-2 variant replaces the roster TM-2 for this scenario
 *     only (same NORAD 61526; the canonical satellite is not in the list).
 *   - ephemerisError 0.18/0.12 deg: program-track holds a degraded link
 *     (~5 dB down) - bad enough to read, good enough to acquire from.
