/**
 * NATS Level 23: "Emergency Bypass"
 *
 * Phase: Crisis Operations (Phase 3, Scenario 7 of 8)
 * Time Pressure: Moderate - the link is up but the safety net is gone
 * Calculation Required: NO (the pointing solution is on the prediction sheet)
 * New Mechanic: ACU automation fault (engine: isAcuAutomationFaulted disables
 *   program-track / step-track / move-to-target; manual servos still work).
 *   First scenario where the automation itself is the broken thing.
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - S0424: Skill in executing command line tools (manual operation)
 *   - T1588: Diagnose faulty system and server hardware
 *   - S0671: Skill in implementing contingency and recovery plans
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - T0531: Troubleshoot hardware/software interoperability problems
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating network equipment
 *   - K1032: Knowledge of satellite-based communication systems
 *
 * Premise: The ACU automation controller crashed mid-shift. Program-track,
 * move-to-target, and step-track are unavailable; the dish is parked where
 * automation left it - on TIDEMARK-1. Servos and manual mode still work. The
 * operator must switch to manual deliberately, prove pointing against the
 * prediction sheet using the beacon (the ACU lock logic is dead, so the
 * spectrum is the only truth source), hold the link, and resist rebooting the
 * controller while IT works the root cause.
 *
 * TIDEMARK-1 is GEO and well-behaved, so manual holding is feasible for a
 * shift - the lesson is that manual ops is a fallback competency, and that the
 * automation was doing real work the operator must now do by hand.
 *
 * Tone: Crisis-phase. Dana at the console (intro + IT updates), IT rendered as
 * SYSTEM ticket notes. All quizzes SYSTEM. 4 clips.
 *
 * Sim notes:
 *   - VT-01 antenna starts on TIDEMARK-1 (program-track, locked) but with
 *     isAcuAutomationFaulted: true. The faulted automation means the operator
 *     cannot use program-track/step-track; the objective is to commit to
 *     MANUAL and prove the link there.
 *   - In manual mode the dish holds position (GEO bird barely moves over a
 *     shift), so beacon + carrier stay locked once the operator is on target.
