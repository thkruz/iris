/**
 * NATS Level 24: "Constellation Crisis"
 *
 * Phase: Crisis Operations (Phase 3 capstone, Scenario 8 of 8) - CAMPAIGN FINALE
 * Time Pressure: High - five concurrent tracks, three on clocks you don't control
 * Calculation Required: NO (every mechanic was taught; this is orchestration)
 * New Value: holding five tracks at once without dropping one - multi-station,
 *   multi-satellite, multi-customer, plus a board note. No new mechanics; the
 *   Working Document is the incident-command log / after-action report.
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - S0807: Skill in solving problems
 *   - T1606: Prepare impact reports
 *   - T0531: Troubleshoot hardware/software interoperability problems
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - T1538: Resolve customer-reported system incidents
 *   - S0593: Skill in handling incidents
 *   - S0677: Skill in recovering failed systems
 *   - T1429: Prepare trend analysis reports
 *   - T1144: Implement network backup and recovery procedures
 *
 * Premise: A compound emergency. A storm front is inbound on VT-01 (S14
 * playbook: heater before the front). ME-02's BUC is running hot, same
 * signature as S13 (de-rate). AURORA-7 has a booked SeaLink pass at a marginal,
 * end-of-life beacon (S6/S22). Two customers escalate, and the board wants a
 * note. The operator holds incident command across both stations and all
 * channels, ordering the board and bending the trends, logging it as they go.
 *
 * The campaign finale: every Phase 1-3 skill, exercised together, under the
 * one pressure no single prior scenario applied - holding the whole job in
 * your head at once.
 *
 * Tone: Capstone - the one Phase 2/3 scenario where dialog density expands
 * (8-10 clips). All named characters appear. Quizzes SYSTEM. The Working
 * Document is the incident-command log.
 *
 * Sim notes:
 *   - VT-01: TIDEMARK-1, storm inbound (weather event at T+240, heater off so
 *     the operator must enable it proactively - S14 discipline). AURORA-7 also
 *     visible/usable from VT-01 for the pass.
 *   - ME-02: TIDEMARK-2, BUC over-gain/hot (S13 signature) - de-rate to clear.
 *   - The Working Document accumulates the incident-command log from the
 *     triage/decision/board quizzes.

Maine's BUC is running hot - the same unit, the same signature as the thermal trend you caught months ago, and the swap never cleared procurement. AURORA-7 has a SeaLink sync pass booked at 0800 on a beacon four dB weaker than the day you qualified. James is already calling. Francis wants a board note by end of morning.<br><br>Five tracks. Three are clocks you don't control - the storm, the pass window, the board deadline. Two are trends you can bend - the BUC heat, the customer's confidence.<br><br>You've done every piece of this before. Today you do all of it, in the right order, while everyone watches. Incident command is yours. Dana is your resource, not your safety net. This is the exam - fly it like a Tuesday.`,
