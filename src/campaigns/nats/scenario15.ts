/**
 * NATS Level 15: "Frequency Coordination"
 *
 * Phase: Qualified Operations (Phase 2, Scenario 7 of 8)
 * Time Pressure: Moderate (RedSky's uplink window opens in 25 minutes)
 * Calculation Required: YES - guard-band arithmetic
 * New Mechanic Introduced: External-operator coordination (not present in S1-S14)
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - K0737: Knowledge of bandwidth management tools and techniques
 *   - T1143: Develop network backup and recovery procedures
 *   - S0648: Skill in detecting anomalies
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - K0792: Knowledge of network configurations
 *   - K0773: Knowledge of telecommunications principles and practices
 *   - S0593: Skill in handling incidents
 *   - K0645: Knowledge of standard operating procedures (SOPs)
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating network equipment
 *   - K0721: Knowledge of risk management principles and practices
 *
 * Premise: A coordination notice has arrived from RedSky Teleport. Their next
 * scheduled uplink will sit on TIDEMARK-3's V-pol cross-pol slot at 5961 MHz
 * center, 8 MHz BW. Edge-to-edge guard band against our active SeaLink carrier
 * (5985 MHz center, 36 MHz BW H-pol on TP-1) is only 2 MHz.
 *
 * VT-01's HPA is currently running at 5 dB backoff - close enough to saturation
 * that third-order IMD products extend well into RedSky's planned slot. Polarization
 * isolation alone won't save us at this distance. The player must verify the guard
 * band, recognize the IMD risk, raise HPA backoff to 10 dB, confirm the customer
 * carrier is still nominal, and send a clean coordination confirmation back to RedSky.
 *
 * S5 was "someone else interfered with us." S15 reverses the perspective: make sure
 * we are not interfering with them. The mitigation is the HPA backoff lever - the
 * same control surface used in S2 and S9, but exercised for a coordination reason
 * rather than amplifier protection.
 *
 * Tone: Qualified-operator. Dana opens with a text-message notice, checks in at the
 * mitigation point, and signs off when the confirmation goes back to RedSky. Every
 * status-check uses Character.SYSTEM. RedSky's coordinator is rendered through
 * SYSTEM quizzes and objective descriptions, not as a new character.
 *
 * Story Continuity:
 *   - Charlie is in Europe; not involved.
 *   - Dana is the only named voice.
 *   - RedSky is a partner teleport, not part of the NATS roster.
 *   - TIDEMARK-3 is the customer-traffic bird here (carrying SeaLink).
