/**
 * nats-eu Scenario 3 - "Two-Way Street" / First Commanding Window
 *
 * New mechanic: M2 LEO uplink ops (TT&C tab). Until now GW-01 has only
 * listened. This is the first time the station transmits at a LEO bird, which
 * introduces the thing GEO work never taught: the uplink Doppler shift moves
 * several tens of kHz across a seven-minute pass, so the command carrier has to
 * be pre-compensated or the spacecraft receiver never sees it.
 *
 * Command window is bounded to the MERIDIAN-SAR-1 pass (AOS T+3.2, LOS T+10.3
 * on the 2027-03-15 14:00 scenario clock): windowStartS 220 .. windowEndS 600.
 * A command sent outside that window is rejected, which is the point.
 *
 * Key status starts Valid and `requireValidKey` is off here - COMSEC key
 * handling is scenario 4's lesson, deliberately not stacked on top of this one.
 *
 * SAFETY NOTE for the objective order below: enabling the HPA while the BUC has
 * no drive trips the HPA_NOISE_AMPLIFICATION invariant and fails the mission.
 * The objectives therefore key the modem BEFORE enabling the HPA, and the
 * descriptions say so explicitly.
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - T1567: Conduct satellite command and control operations
 *   - K1032: Knowledge of satellite-based communication systems
 *   - K0773: Knowledge of telemetry, tracking and commanding principles
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating network equipment
 *   - K0645: Knowledge of standard operating procedures
