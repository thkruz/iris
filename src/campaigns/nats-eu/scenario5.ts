/**
 * nats-eu Scenario 5 - "Shetland Comes Online" / Two-Station Pass Network
 *
 * New mechanic: M3 multi-station contact scheduling (Contact Plan tab), and the
 * debut of SH-02 Shetland with Fiona MacLeod operating it.
 *
 * The scheduling puzzle is built from two conflicting pairs. Both sites can see
 * each MERIDIAN pass, but a single antenna cannot work two overlapping windows,
 * so the plan is only valid when each pair is split across the two stations:
 *
 *   SAR1-GW (T+3.2 .. T+10.3)  overlaps  SAR1-SH (T+5.0 .. T+12.7)
 *   SAR2-GW (T+18.7 .. T+25.7) overlaps  SAR2-SH (T+20.0 .. T+27.5)
 *
 * Every contact is priority <= 2 and `requiredPriorityAtOrAbove: 2`, so all four
 * must be allocated before the plan validates.
 *
 * MODELING NOTE: satellite az/el is Galway-relative (see the SH-02 comment in
 * ground-stations.ts), so this scenario allocates contacts to Shetland but never
 * asks the operator to track from it. The window times above are authored to
 * represent Shetland's higher-latitude geometry, not propagated from it.
 *
