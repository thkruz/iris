/**
 * nats-eu Scenario 6 - "Watch the Watchers" / Station Security Baseline
 *
 * New mechanic: M6 SOC-lite security console. Deliberately NOT a SOC: the
 * console does log review, event acknowledgement, and account state. No IDS, no
 * packet capture, no firewall - a ground-station operator's security hygiene,
 * which is what the NICE work roles this scenario claims actually describe.
 *
 * The audit log mixes routine traffic with one benign-but-wrong finding: a
 * maintenance contractor account left active after the install window closed,
 * with off-hours authentication failures against it. Nothing was breached. The
 * lesson is that "nothing happened" is a conclusion you reach by looking, and
 * that a dormant over-privileged account is a finding whether or not it was used.
 *
 * The 'evt-replay' critical event is intentionally NOT in this scenario - the
 * replayed-command thread belongs to the Phase 3 adversary arc (S17, S21), and
 * pulling it forward would spend it.
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - K0685: Knowledge of system administration concepts
 *   - K0686: Knowledge of account management
 *   - T1569: Perform account management
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - S0844: Skill in auditing system activity
 *   - K0645: Knowledge of standard operating procedures
