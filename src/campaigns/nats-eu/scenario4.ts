/**
 * nats-eu Scenario 4 - "Keys to the Bird" / Command-Link COMSEC
 *
 * New mechanic: M5 command-link authentication and key operations. Scenario 3
 * proved GW-01 can reach the spacecraft; this one adds the requirement that the
 * spacecraft can prove the command came from NATS. `requireValidKey` is on, so
 * a command sent on a key that is mid-rotation is rejected - the operator has to
 * complete the scheduled rotation before the window closes.
 *
 * Command window is the MERIDIAN-SAR-1 pass again (AOS T+3.2, LOS T+10.3):
 * windowStartS 220 .. windowEndS 600. Doppler compensation is still required -
 * scenario 3's lesson does not get switched off because a new one arrived.
 *
 * The console's zeroize control is deliberately arm-then-fire and is NOT part of
 * any objective here: emergency key destruction is scenario 21's lesson, and an
 * accidental zeroize during a routine rotation should feel like the serious
 * mistake it is.
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - K0874: Knowledge of cryptographic key management concepts
 *   - K0875: Knowledge of cryptology
 *   - K0728: Knowledge of cryptographic key storage and handling
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - S0077: Skill in securing network communications
 *   - T1567: Conduct satellite command and control operations
