/**
 * nats-eu Scenario 7 - "Moving Target" / Ephemeris Management
 *
 * New mechanic: M4 space-domain events. A conjunction-avoidance burn invalidates
 * the element set the station has been tracking on. The operator sees the
 * ephemeris go stale on the Pass Schedule tab, loads the post-maneuver TLE, and
 * reacquires the bird.
 *
 * AUTHORING NOTES - two deliberate deviations from the campaign design plan,
 * both for playability:
 *
 * 1. The design plan assigns the burn to MERIDIAN-SAR-2, whose pass is at
 *    T+18.7 min. Using SAR-1 (AOS T+3.2, LOS T+10.3) instead keeps the whole
 *    scenario inside ~12 minutes rather than ~25, and the lesson - notice the
 *    stale set, load the update, reacquire - is identical.
 * 2. `maneuverAtS` is measured in WALL-CLOCK seconds from SpaceEventManager
 *    construction (the same quirk the Campaign 4 retro flagged for
 *    hardwareFaultEvents), not scenario-clock seconds. 60 s puts the notice on
 *    the console well before AOS while leaving time to act. If the operator is
 *    slow the stale state persists, so the pass is still recoverable.
 *
 * The post-maneuver element set is a small perturbation (RAAN +0.2 deg, mean
 * anomaly +0.5 deg), which shifts the pass by under ten seconds - a real
 * avoidance burn, not a new orbit.
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - K1032: Knowledge of satellite-based communication systems
 *   - T0431: Monitor and maintain system operations
 *   - T1138: Perform system reconfiguration
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - S0421: Skill in operating network equipment
 *   - K0740: Knowledge of system performance indicators
