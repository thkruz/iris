/**
 * nats-eu Scenario 2 - "Proving the Link" / Acceptance Testing & Link Budgets
 *
 * New mechanic: M1 link-budget / EIRP planning console (Link Analysis tab).
 * GW-01 is still in commissioning, so every claimed number has to be proven on
 * a test card: predict the C/N for the next MERIDIAN-SAR-1 pass from first
 * principles, then commit the link during the pass and show the measured margin
 * clears the demod threshold.
 *
 * Pass timeline (scenario clock starts 2027-03-15 14:00:00 UTC), identical to
 * scenario 1 so the RF envelope is the one Phase A validated:
 * - MERIDIAN-SAR-1: AOS T+3.2 min, max el 28.0 deg at T+6.8, LOS T+10.3 min
 *
 * Link-budget numbers (measured, not assumed - see
 * test/campaigns/nats-eu-phase-b-validation.test.ts):
 * - slant range at max elevation 761 km -> FSPL 171.4 dB at 11686 MHz
 * - EIRP 28 dBm, GW-01 4m Ku gain 51.8 dBi, Tsys 88 K, BW 36 MHz, misc 1 dB
 * - correct worksheet -> C/N 10.96 dB (expectedCNRDb 11.0, tolerance 1.0)
 * - measured peak through the real chain: 10.93 dB at T+6.8
 * - threshold 6 dB (QPSK 3/4 demod) + 2 dB required margin -> commit anywhere in
 *   the 193 s window T+5.2 .. T+8.4, which is the same window S1 already asks
 *   the operator to hit.
 *
 * NICE Framework Alignment:
 * Primary Codes:
 *   - T0080: Test and evaluate system performance against requirements
 *   - S0015: Skill in conducting test events
 *   - K0740: Knowledge of system performance indicators
 *
 * Supporting Codes:
 *   - K1032: Knowledge of satellite-based communication systems
 *   - K0645: Knowledge of standard operating procedures
