/**
 * NATS Europe - Galway Ground Station (GW-01)
 *
 * Ku-band LEO downlink station on the Irish west coast. Frequency plan:
 * - LNB LO 13100 MHz (high-side): 11686 MHz video -> 1414 MHz IF,
 *   11711 MHz beacon -> 1389 MHz IF (both inside the 950-2150 MHz L-band IF;
 *   the beacon sits above the video's 11668-11704 MHz occupied band so the
 *   CW tone is not blocked by the stronger co-channel carrier)
 * - BUC LO 12600 MHz (low-side): 1405 MHz IF -> 14005 MHz Ku uplink
 * - Fast 4m pedestal (KU_BAND_4M_LEO_TRACKER, 20 deg/s) for LEO tracking

/**
 * NATS Europe - Shetland Ground Station (SH-02)
 *
 * The second EU site, debuting in scenario 5. Deliberately the SAME hardware as
 * GW-01 (4m Ku LEO tracker, identical frequency plan) so the lesson the
 * two-station scenarios teach is *scheduling*, not new equipment.
 *
 * Its higher latitude (60.15 N vs Galway's 53.27 N) gives complementary pass
 * geometry on sun-synchronous birds - more passes per day, and overlap windows
 * with Galway that the operator has to deconflict.
 *
 * KNOWN MODELING LIMIT: OrbitalSatellite carries a single observer (Galway), so
 * satellite az/el/range telemetry is Galway-relative everywhere. Contact
 * planning across the two sites is therefore modeled abstractly by
 * ContactScheduleManager (windows + conflicts) rather than by propagating each
 * station separately. Scenarios must not ask the operator to *track* from
 * SH-02; they allocate contacts to it. Lifting this needs per-station
 * propagation in OrbitalSatellite.
