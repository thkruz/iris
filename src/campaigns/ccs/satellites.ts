/**
 * Campaign 4 (9th EWS / Counter Communications) satellite roster.
 *
 * COBALT-4 is the adversary X-band SATCOM bird the operator must deny. Its
 * transponder carries the adversary's own service uplink, which is relayed to
 * the co-frequency downlink; the operator's jam, once injected into the same
 * uplink passband, degrades that downlink's C/I (the denial effect).
 *
 * SGP4-propagated from a real GEO slot, like Campaign 5's SENTRY birds. It was
 * a fixed-geometry Satellite with authored az 175 / el 30 until phase 9; those
 * two angles cannot both hold for a geostationary bird seen from 34 deg N
 * (azimuth 175 fixes the slot 2.8 deg east of the site meridian, which is 50.4
 * deg of elevation, not 30). A satellite with no ephemeris also cannot appear
 * on the world map or ground track. Authoring the orbit fixed both: azimuth was
 * kept and elevation follows the geometry.
 *
 * TLE authored by scripts/author-tle-ccs.mjs against the 2027-11-05 02:00:00
 * UTC scenario epoch:
 * - slot 115.1W, inclination 0.05 deg -> az 174.9 / el 50.4 from SANDSTORM,
 *   holding to within 0.05 deg across the 3-hour scenario window, so the
 *   authored pointing objectives stay satisfiable at a fixed look angle.
 *
 * X-band plan (mil band: 7.25-7.75 GHz down, 7.9-8.4 GHz up):
 * - Service uplink RF: 8125 MHz (H-pol) -> transponded downlink 7475 MHz
 *   (frequencyOffset 650 MHz)
 * - Telemetry beacon: 7290 MHz (CW) for target ID on the spectrum
 * The jam must land in the 8100-8150 MHz uplink passband to be transponded onto
 * the victim downlink.
