/**
 * Campaign 4 (9th EWS / Counter Communications) - Scenario 2 "Failover"
 *
 * First scored mission of the arc; builds on the "Blackout" sandbox
 * (ccs-scenario1), which already walks the operator through aperture
 * coordination, the first denial, and a single failover. This one is the
 * contingency shift: the same SANDSTORM site, the same COBALT-4 target, but
 * the denial has to be HELD through two transmit-string trips while the
 * adversary tries to recover his link.
 *
 * Fault model (what the engine can and cannot do):
 * - `hardwareFaultEvents` trips a transmitter MODEM (the exciter): it faults,
 *   stops radiating, and stays latched until the operator runs the string's
 *   fault reset with the string un-keyed. The two jam strings share one
 *   BUC/HPA on rfFrontEnd 0, so an "HPA trip" cannot be represented - the
 *   scheduled faults are exciter trips and the diagnosis the operator must
 *   make is exactly that: exciter down, amplifier healthy, keep the HPA up
 *   and change strings.
 * - `fault-active` / `fault-cleared` read the payload FaultInjector, not the
 *   hardware-fault schedule, so the trips are detected through the string
 *   itself: `tx-modem-not-transmitting` on the string that just went down.
 *
 * Timeline (mission elapsed, HardwareFaultManager clock):
 * - T+0      tasking acknowledged, monitor aperture slewed on, JAM-A keyed
 * - ~T+4-6   first hold: 120 s of continuous denial on the primary
 * - T+480    JAM-A exciter trips -> fail over to JAM-B inside 180 s
 * - ~T+11    second hold: 120 s of continuous denial on the backup
 * - T+840    JAM-B exciter trips -> reset a cooled string and re-key inside 150 s
 * - then     hold 180 s to the recall, cease fire cleanly
 *
 * The scheduled trips fire on the mission clock regardless of objective
 * progress. Every objective after the first trip grades the EFFECT (any string
 * radiating in band with J/S at threshold), never a particular modem, so a
 * slow operator who meets a trip early is never dead-ended: any string can be
 * reset and re-keyed.

  description: `Second night on COBALT-4. The tasking order wants the adversary's X-band service link denied for the full window, and the crew chief has left you a warning: the JAM-A exciter has a thermal history, the tent swapped its fan yesterday, and nobody trusts it yet. JAM-B is the spare. Both strings drive the same amplifier.
  <br/><br/>Bring the monitor aperture onto the bird, key the primary, and drive the link to DENIED. Then hold it. When a string trips, read the panel before you touch anything: work out which module actually failed, keep the amplifier up, change strings, and restore the effect before the adversary's link comes back. Expect more than one trip. The friendly MILSATCOM band at 8175-8225 MHz is protected the whole shift - radiate into it and the mission is over.`,
