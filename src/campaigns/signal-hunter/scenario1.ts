/**
 * Campaign 5 (Signal Hunter) - Scenario 1: "First Fix"
 *
 * First scored mission of the arc. The sandbox walked the loop with the
 * numbers handed over; here the operator earns them:
 * - detect an intermittent carrier inside SENTRY-7 TP-1 and work its uplink
 *   frequency back from the IF on the analyzer (LNB LO 5150, TP-1 +2225),
 * - time a sparse duty cycle (40 s on / 90 s off, ~30%) that leaves a 12 s
 *   correlator window little slack - captures must be started inside the
 *   on-window or the console reports NO CORRELATION,
 * - collect at least six captures across the cycle, fix within 25 km, and
 *   file the incident characterization (duty cycle, bandwidth, polarization),
 * - stretch: keep collecting until the fix closes to 15 km.
 *
 * Emitter ground truth: a ranch airstrip in Quay County, eastern New Mexico
 * (35.17N 103.72W, 1.25 km MSL). Achievability of the 25 km / 15 km targets
 * against the 1.5 us / 3 Hz measurement noise is held by
 * test/campaigns/signal-hunter-scenario1-validation.test.ts, which solves the
 * same geometry headlessly at the scenario epoch.
 *
 * Scenario clock 2027-09-01 06:00:00 UTC (0000 MDT) - the epoch the SENTRY
 * TLEs were authored against (both birds ~47 deg elevation from PA-22).
 *
 * Frequency plan for this incident:
 * - Hostile uplink 6021 MHz H-pol, 3 MHz wide, inside TP-1 (5990-6030)
 * - Relayed downlink 3796 MHz -> 1354 MHz IF (service carrier sits at 1365)
 *

The correlator integrates for twelve seconds and will not correlate on an interferer that goes quiet halfway through, so your captures have to be started inside the on-window. Six good captures across the cycle should put a 25 km fix on the map. The cell wants it, with the characterization, before the 0100Z sync.`,
