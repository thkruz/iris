/**
 * Campaign 5 (Signal Hunter) satellite roster.
 *
 * Two SGP4-propagated GEO birds (real az/el/range from TLEs, same physics as
 * Campaign 2's LEO fleet - not the faked figure-8 GEO of Campaign 1). Both are
 * inclined (3.0 / 4.5 deg) so their subpoints trace sizeable daily figure-8s.
 * That N-S velocity is deliberate: it rotates the FDOA gradient off the TDOA
 * gradient so the emitter's LATITUDE is observable (a near-equatorial pair
 * leaves the N-S fix ambiguous), and it makes successive FDOA measurements
 * rotate the line of position so the fix tightens over the collection.
 *
 * TLEs authored by scripts/author-tle-signal-hunter.mjs against the
 * 2027-09-01 06:00:00 UTC scenario epoch (see that script for geometry +
 * TDOA/FDOA observability validation):
 * - SENTRY-7 (victim): slot 100.2W, el 47.1 deg / az 172.5 from the station
 * - SENTRY-9 (adjacent collector): slot 98.1W, el 48.1 deg / az 168.7
 *
 * Frequency plan (C-band):
 * - Allied service carrier: downlink 3785 MHz, H-pol
 * - Hostile uplink jammer (interferenceEvents): 6013 MHz H-pol, inside the
 *   SENTRY-7 transponder passband -> relayed to 3788 MHz downlink
 * - Station LNB LO 5150 MHz: 3785 MHz -> 1365 MHz IF, jammer -> 1362 MHz IF
