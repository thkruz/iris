/**
 * Campaign 5 (Signal Hunter) - Peterson Annex (PA-22)
 *
 * 22nd Electronic Warfare Squadron field site on the Colorado plains. A C-band
 * 9m dish already program-tracking the victim SENTRY-7 and receiving its
 * allied service carrier (3785 MHz -> 1365 MHz IF, LNB LO 5150). The spectrum
 * analyzer opens on a wide span so the operator can see the intermittent
 * hostile carrier a few MHz off the friendly one.
