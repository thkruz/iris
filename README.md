A web-based training simulation for satellite ground station operations, built with TypeScript and vanilla JavaScript.

## Overview

SignalRange simulates a commercial satellite ground station environment where operators learn to configure and troubleshoot RF equipment chains. The training scenarios are set at North Atlantic Teleport Services (NATS), a fictional satellite ground station facility in Vermont serving the TIDEMARK constellation.

## Campaign 1: North Atlantic Teleport Services (NATS)

Five scenarios (with three more coming in January) taking you from observation to independent operations at a commercial C-band ground station in Vermont. Progress from health checks and maintenance procedures through satellite handovers, acquisitions, and RF troubleshooting. See the [scenario guide](https://docs.signalrange.space) for details.

## 2026 Roadmap

Campaign 1 is the beginning. Here's what's planned for 2026:

### Jan - NATS Scenarios 6-8

Complete the NATS campaign with advanced scenarios: rain fade compensation, full link budget analysis, and independent troubleshooting under time pressure.

### Q1 - Campaign 2: European Operations

Charlie transfers to NATS Europe. LEO satellite tracking, multi-contact mission planning, video feed decoding, and Ku-band operations.

### Q2 - Campaign 3: Backyard Operator

Charlie's niece teaches you how to track satellites from your backyard. Software-defined radios, SatNOGS, circular polarization, GPS signal tracking, and DIY antenna setups.

### Q3 - Campaign 4: Electronic Warfare

Military counter-communications operations. SATCOM denial, redundant hardware management, multi-antenna coordination, X-band.

### Q4 - Campaign 5: Signal Hunter

Someone is jamming allied satellites. Find them using geolocation and advanced RF techniques.

## Equipment Simulated

- **9m C-band Antenna** - Pointing, tracking modes, polarization control
- **LNB** - Local oscillator, gain, thermal stabilization
- **BUC** - Block upconverter with mute control
- **HPA** - High power amplifier with safety interlocks
- **IF Filter Bank** - Bandwidth selection
- **GPSDO** - GPS-disciplined oscillator for frequency reference
- **Spectrum Analyzer** - Real-time RF visualization
- **Receiver/Transmitter Modems** - Signal demodulation and generation

## 🛠️ Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 24.x (see `.nvmrc`; [Volta](https://volta.sh) picks it up automatically)
- **pnpm** 10.x — `corepack enable` or `npm install -g pnpm@10`

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thkruz/SignalRange.git
cd SignalRange

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Pull campaign assets from R2 (audio/images)
pnpm run r2:pull

# 5. Start the development server
pnpm run dev
```

> **Note:** `src/private` is an optional, private git submodule (plans, design docs and internal
> notes). Contributors do not need it and the build never reads it. Clone without
> `--recurse-submodules`, or ignore the "permission denied" from that one submodule if you do.

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in terminal).

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | For auth features | Your Supabase project URL |
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | For auth features | Supabase anonymous/public key |
| `PUBLIC_USER_API_URL` | No | User API endpoint (has default) |
| `PUBLIC_ASSETS_BASE_URL` | No | Leave empty for local dev |

For local development without authentication features, the default `.env.example` values work out of the box.

### Asset Management

Campaign assets (audio files, character images) are stored in Cloudflare R2 and not committed to the repository.

```bash
# Download assets from R2 (no authentication required)
pnpm run r2:pull

# Preview what would be downloaded
pnpm run r2:pull:dry
```

Assets are downloaded to `public/assets/campaigns/` and `public/assets/characters/`.

### Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm run dev` | Start webpack dev server with hot reload |
| `pnpm run build` | Production build to `dist/` |
| `pnpm run preview` | Preview production build with Wrangler |
| `pnpm run r2:pull` | Download campaign assets from R2 |
| `pnpm test` | Run the Vitest suite |
| `pnpm run typecheck` | Type-check with tsgo (TypeScript 7 native) |
| `pnpm run typecheck:tsc` | Same check on stock tsc, as a fallback |
| `pnpm run lint` | Lint and format-check with Biome |
| `pnpm run lint:fix` | Apply Biome's safe fixes |
| `pnpm run format` | Format with Biome |

### Troubleshooting

**Assets not loading?**
Run `pnpm run r2:pull` to download campaign audio and images.

**TypeScript errors?**
Run `pnpm run typecheck` to see detailed type errors.

**Port already in use?**
The dev server defaults to port 3000. Check for other processes or modify `webpack.config.js`.

## 🌐 Deployment

SignalRange is deployed on Cloudflare Workers with static assets. There are two environments:

| Environment    | URL                               | Purpose                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Production** | <https://app.signalrange.space>   | Live user-facing application            |
| **UAT**        | <https://uat.signalrange.space>   | Pre-production testing and validation   |

### Deploy Commands

```bash
# Deploy to UAT (test changes first)
pnpm exec wrangler deploy --env uat

# Deploy to Production (after UAT validation)
pnpm exec wrangler deploy --env production
```

Always deploy to UAT first to validate changes before promoting to production.
